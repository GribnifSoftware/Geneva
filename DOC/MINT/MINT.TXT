Using Geneva with MiNT
----------------------

  Geneva can be used with MiNT (MiNT is Now TOS), from Eric Smith and Atari
  Corp. Without MiNT, Geneva runs in cooperative multitasking mode (where
  switching to another process depends on it making calls to the AES).
  With MiNT, Geneva uses preemptive multitasking (which gives an equal
  amount of time to each process, regardless of what it is doing.)
  
  All of MiNT's normal features are available, like pipes, alternate
  filesystems, etc. However, while the preemptive mode does prevent
  programs from tying up the entire system, it is generally slower and
  continues to get slower the more processes you run. This mode is also
  less compatible with older applications.

  Geneva was tested with version 1.12 of MiNT. Older versions may or may
  not work properly.


Installation
------------

  In order to install it, you have the choice of two setups:

  Setup #1: Easy method

  o You will already have JARxxx.PRG and GENEVA.PRG in your AUTO folder,
    for the non-MiNT installation. Just add MINTNP.PRG to your AUTO
    folder, making sure it is physically **last**.

  o If you use NeoDesk, you must run NEOLOAD.PRG in the AUTO folder before
    MINTNP.PRG. Generally speaking, most TSR's work best when run in the
    AUTO folder prior to MINTNP.PRG.

  o If there is to be a MINT.CNF file in the root directory of the boot
    disk, make sure it does not contain any lines beginning with either
    "INIT=" or "GEM=". These would load another shell in place of Geneva.

  Setup #2: Slightly more difficult, but more flexible

  o JARxxx.PRG must run in the AUTO folder. GENEVA.PRG must NOT, however.
    It must be de-activated.

  o MINTNP.PRG should be in the AUTO folder, in the last physical position.
    The current version of Geneva cannot be used with memory protection
    (MINT.PRG).

  o If you use NeoDesk, you must run NEOLOAD.PRG in the AUTO folder before
    MINTNP.PRG. Generally speaking, most TSR's work best when run in the
    AUTO folder prior to MINTNP.PRG.

  o MINT.CNF, in the root directory of the boot drive, should contain the
    line:

    GEM=<path>\geneva.prg

    For example, if you have copied GENEVA.PRG to the folder C:\GENEVA\,
    use the line:

    GEM=c:\geneva\geneva.prg

    If you use a boot manager, you can even be a little more creative.
    Since you will already have a de-activated GENEVA.PRX in your AUTO
    folder, you can use the line:

    GEM=c:\auto\geneva.prx

    This latter approach avoids the need to copy GENEVA.PRG to another
    folder.

    The MINT.CNF must not contain any "INIT=..." lines.
