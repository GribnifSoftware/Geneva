\index
  This is an optional index. Without it, the default alphabetical index
  would be used.

          Double-click on a screen name below:

  \#First Screen\#      \#Second Screen\#      \#Third Screen\#
  \#Test "extern"\#     \#Test aliases\#
\end

\screen Normal Topic
\screen First Screen
First Screen

  This is the text of a help screen which can be found regardless of the
  case of the string the user supplies.
  
  Here is a reference to the screen, below:  \#Second Screen\#
        and a reference to a \##hidden\# screen:  \#Hidden\#
\end

\casesens Second Screen
Second Screen

  This screen can be jumped to from the \#First Screen\#, or it can be
  searched for in the index.
\end

\screen Test "extern"
Test of "extern" function

  This screen contains a reference to a topic which appears in the file
  TASKMAN.HLP. The "extern" function instructs the help viewer to look
  in a particular HLP file first.

  Jump to TASKMAN.HLP:   \#Task Manager\#

  \@extern TASKMAN.HLP
\end

\screen Test aliases
Test of aliases

  This should \#{Hidden}be good\#, right?
\end

\hidden Hidden
\screen Third Screen
Third Screen

  While the name "Third Screen" will appear in the index, the name
  "Hidden" will not. Furthermore, it cannot be searched for at all.
\end
