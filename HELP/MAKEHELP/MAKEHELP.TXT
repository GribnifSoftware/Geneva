Geneva Makehelp Utility version 1.1
-----------------------------------

The instructions for creating source files to be compiled into HLP files
are contained in the file MAKEHELP.HLP. To view this file, you need to use
GNVAHELP.PRG.

Either run GNVAELP and use its File->Open menu entry to load MAKEHELP.HLP,
or, if using NeoDesk, drag MAKEHELP.HLP to GNVAHELP.PRG.
